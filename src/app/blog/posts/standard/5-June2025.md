## from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Hello my beautiful friends. Welcome to the semi-spring semi-birthday edition of the Soapbox! It is a gorgeous day here in Boston with spring blooms almost complete. I think I bloom around this time too, especially because I came into the world during spring. On Earth day actually! I recently turned 25 years old and this birthday was really special for me. It marks the full development of my brain which may sound silly but it’s a fact I don’t take lightly. I really value my maturity and the ways in which I have grown into an adult. I remember the last big birthday I had was when I turned 22. It was a big deal to me because it was supposed to be my golden birthday. 22 on 4 - 22 - 2022 (2+2 = 4! April! Crazy..) and I thought something amazing was going to happen to me. Something precious, something golden…but I spent that birthday sick with some unknown illness, mostly alone in my room.

I was sick in more ways than one, reeling from heartbreak from someone that I pushed away because I was more loyal to my anger and my resentment than I was to our relationship. Later that day I was able to muster some strength and convince a friend of mine to go see a movie with me since I still wanted to celebrate my golden birthday in some capacity. We went to see the movie Everything Everywhere All At Once, which is a movie about being confronted with the lives you could have led had you made a different choice but understanding that even in the “worst” universe there is still meaning in a life you build with love. Leading with love is not naive but strategic and necessary. The movie felt like a divine intervention for me to start my path towards redemption. I reflect on all this as I contemplate being 25 and the ways I have really turned my life around by trying my best to be more loyal to love than anything else. For my 25th birthday I wanted to honor the person I once was and also celebrate the person I have now become. I figured what better way to do that than to throw the quince I never had?

_yes! that is me!_

In Latin America, you become a woman when you have your quinceñera on your 15th birthday. Luckily, I wasn’t forced to have a quinceñera party and so I narrowly evaded becoming a woman and became something else. Not a man, but a secret third thing. 10 years after the day I was supposed to turn into a woman, I decided to try it out for one night only. I compiled photos and video from the party if you would like to skip around and relive the night. You can do that [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EUuTGrkENLDNAgY4bN9Pm28q9JCz8q2Y). 

April was a month where friends were the highlight. I even got to visit a beloved friend of mine, Clarice, in Cape Verde for 10 days. We first met when I was just 19 studying in Cape Verde for the summer. Somehow the country got even more beautiful the second time around because Clarice now has a lovely 2 year old daughter, Carolina, and an amazing husband, Juka!

Yet sometimes it feels like you can’t have flowers without thunder. Truth is, Cape Verde was my safe place during a time when I felt very attacked and a bit vulnerable. Clarice and Cape Verde healed me. The week before I left for Cape Verde, an Israeli woman who works on my floor at my job filed a complaint against me for my anti-apartheid poster saying it glorified violence. The poster had been up for over a year and this woman works nowhere near my desk. This woman revealed to my boss that she thought I was Palestinian. What is even more unsettling is that this woman made the complaint the week that many Palestinian activists were being detained in the United States, not for what they did but for what they believed in. She profiled me and felt empowered by a racist administration to create a complaint against me where none existed. My boss made me take my poster down but I immediately replaced it with a blank sheet of white paper. The next day the the sheet of paper was gone and I found an email from my boss claiming that I had retaliated against the zionist and “escalated” things by replacing the poster with a white sheet.

I was honestly a bit scared I could be fired or worse. Thankfully, I had the PSL as a resource and was coached on how to proceed. Eventually, I was able to get my boss to admit over email that she could not name which policy I broke or how, which made her back off.  I told everyone on my floor what had happened and they all took my side. The next time I saw my boss I told her that she cosigned and validated a racist profiling and that I found her problematic and insecure (how are you going to take a white sheet of paper so personally??). She was actually so shocked to me standing up to her that she started crying a bit. It was all very crazy to witness.

About a week after that, I was able to finalize a rent reduction with my landlord that would allow me to move out before my lease ends. It’s something I had been working on with my landlord for several months because I wanted to spend my summer in Mexico and NC. The rent reduction was finalized shortly after I confronted my boss and I was given back my security deposit. With my security deposit back, I felt I had enough money to leave my job in May and use June to pack and hang out with my friends in Boston. I’m so grateful to my friends in the PSL that coached me so that I was able to leave my job on my own terms. My official last day at my job was this past Thursday, May 29th. Shortly before I left, I was informed about a “pension cash balance” that my company made for me when I started my job which I had no knowledge of. The benefit representative told me I was “100% vested” and could withdraw the whole amount since it’s under a certain amount of money.  I then learned I had over 2k in the account!! It really felt like the universe was compensating me for the racist bullshit. So, with this “pension” and my other savings, I begin the next chapter of my life. Moving out of Boston to NC to live with my mom and apply like crazy to remote biotech jobs that would allow me to finally move to Mexico City! My aunt even told me I could live with her and my cousin (both of whom I am very close to) in Mexico City for as long as I want. Life was getting too cozy here in Boston. The drama at work and an unexpected 2k was enough to help me finally take the leap I have been dreaming about for so long! I’m excited yet I know the heartbreak of leaving Boston will devastate me, but that’s a topic for another Soapbox…
