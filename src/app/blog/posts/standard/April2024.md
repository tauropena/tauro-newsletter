## a friendly newsletter from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Welcome back my friends to the birthday edition of my newsletter ! On Monday I celebrated my 24th trip around the sun. I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me with the immense task that is growing up. I’m so privileged to be able to reflect on my life and share it with all of you. Thank you for metaphysically dunking my head into a tres leches cake per Mexican birthday tradition.

There is so much to talk about since our last chat. I hardly know where to begin! I guess I’ll start by saying that I got ✨rejected✨ from the Fulbright to go to Mexico City. This is a bummer for so many reasons but ultimately I know it had nothing to do with my capabilities as a scholar. I know the Fulbright would be more than lucky to have me in their program. If all the love my friends provided by praying, manifesting and editing my application wasn’t enough then the Fulbright wasn’t meant for me. I have a wonderful and unshakable faith that I am being guided on a loving path, and this rejection did not change that. Luckily, a few weeks after my rejection I developed a strong crush and a new relationship. I think about them during work meetings, when my boss is talking to me, before bed, and when I wake up. All I want to do is spend all my time with them because they make me so happy. My new love actually isn’t a person, it’s the Boston branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation!

Joining the party has been a highlight for me these past few months. Prior to joining, it was easier for me to believe that humanity would destroy itself before we ever saw the end to the compounding crises that capitalism has created. To be completely honest, I wanted so badly to go to Mexico City because it felt like a blissful escape or a beautiful last breathe before a US American implosion. 

After my rejection I had to confront my fear of the country I was raised in and the idea that the only thing I could do here was participate in my own demise. I found my way to the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) and they taught me revolutionary optimism but more importantly they taught me that it is my duty here in the belly of the beast to fight against the US imperialism machine because no country will ever have a shot at peace as long as it exists. **If we were to boil all of human history down to one calendar year, capitalism has existed for less than one day. Less than one day!!! My life got brighter the day I recognized a US socialist revolution is more plausible than a global death by capitalism.**

And so I spent the anniversary of my birth with members of the PSL. We joined together at the MIT Scientists Against Genocide Student Encampment drenched in love for the MIT students in the PSL that helped start the Pro Palestine encampment. Once MIT PSL members communicated that the Cambridge police threatened to sweep the encampment, PSL members dropped what they were doing and made their way to the encampment. PSL members at Harvard led a march to MIT to increase our people power. The police left after an hour and the encampment continued. Two days later, Northeastern students started their own Pro Palestine encampment except they were met with Boston police in full riot gear, an arrest van, and zip ties. Our party members showed up again and brought an energy that rivaled the heavy presence of the police. After a tense two hours, the police left and made zero arrests. I felt more useful and powerful in those two days than I have during my entire scientific career. United in solidarity against a genocide, 

I remembered my wonderful and unshakable faith that I continue to be guided on a path towards love.
