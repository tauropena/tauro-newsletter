## from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Everyone make some room!! This place just filled up with Boston folk! 

Now that we are all sitting close and cozy- I want to say thanks for stopping by my silly lil newsletter.  For my friends in Boston, this is your first time here so you might be missing some context as to why I wanted to start this in the first place. My absolutely amazing friend Amrita helped me archive my past newsletters onto this website that she basically coded from scratch (and sat with me for hours explaining how to change to my liking). 

Now, A few of y’all think I’m in Mexico City but not quite! I’m writing to you from my mom’s house in North Carolina. It’s always been my plan to spend a decent chunk of time with my mom before moving because I hate only seeing her twice a year and her house is a comfortable environment to look for a remote job (a fridge with fruit 😍). I thought finding a “digital nomad” job would be easy since every American in Mexico City apparently has one but i’m learning digital nomading is kinda… illegal?? I actually did get close to getting a remote biotech sales job and realized that work sounded miserable. Plus- I’m an awful liar and can’t set up all that VPN location stuff to pull off digital nomading. I’m switching gears and looking for in-person jobs in Mexico City even though the pay is very low compared to the US. 

In the meantime I’ve really enjoyed living in my home state even if it feels very emotional being back. The fall wind reminds me of marching band competitions and the sky looks just like it did on my bike in fourth grade. The nostalgia makes my stomach hurt sometimes. I think my mom looks at me and feels the same way.  Is there a difference between nostalgia and grief? Someone ask therapist Chatgpt so it can tell us to kill ourselves. Kidding!

Anyways. I’m learning a lot from my mom these days. We cook together and go to family therapy since she continues to struggle with my “transformation” (a word she likes to use. I like it too). It’s funny, I thought by inheriting her personality I understood her completely because, well, we are the same person. I guess when you think you already know someone it makes it hard to listen, really listen to what they are saying.  For the first time I’m really listening to my mom and realizing I’ve never fully understood her. Our honesty is bringing us so much closer and that’s literally the whole reason why I wanted to come back to NC. I’m grateful for a mom who wants to go to therapy with me even though it’s uncomfortable. I’m grateful for a mom who is more loving than she is flawed.

Unfortunately, coming back to NC meant leaving Boston and I really want to shout out my friends Jaime and Brianna who threw me a goodbye party that I’ll forever cherish. They even rented a bouncy house for me!! I hardly had any room in my heart for sadness because I left Boston with so much joy and happiness thanks to my friends who let me know how much they have enjoyed our time in Boston together. 

Extra thanks to everyone that stopped by my goodbye party and for all the goodbye letters/cards. I want to share a story with y’all to really convey how much those letters mean me.

As most of you know my mom was born and raised in Mexico City. While she was there she attended a teacher’s college and met a woman named Lilian. Her and Lilian became really close friends who were always looking out for each other. One time they worked together at a pretentious summer camp for German-Mexicans where my mom famously folded a kid like a lawn chair, dunked his ass in a toilet and flushed it after he told her to “wipe me like my maids do or else”. I’m pretty sure my mom wanted to be fired but Lilian still tried defending her from their boss. After my mom moved to the States at 26 to be with my father, my mom and Lilian corresponded by letter for years until one day my mom stopped hearing from her. Finally after getting in contact with Lilian’s family my mother was informed that Lilian suffered a tremendous fall and went into a coma. When she woke up she no longer had any memories of who she was. My mom was told that trying to contact Lilian would just make Lilian sad for forgetting who my mom is and so my mom stopped reaching out. 

Twenty years later my mom gets a call from Lilian. She tells my mom how hard it was reintegrating into society after forgetting everything but despite this she managed to hold onto a box of important things that she had created before she lost her memory. In that box were all the letters my mom had written to her. The last letter my mom sent was about me being born. Lilian told my mom “I can’t remember who you are, but I can tell you were very important to me and I would like to be your friend again.” 

All that to say I cherish every letter/card/note written to me no matter how short it is. In fact, I keep them all in a fireproof bag under my bed! Even if I forget who I am I don’t want to forget our friendship and its importance in my life. I always want to be able to come back to it.

Beyond all the sappy stuff I was still able to have lots of fun this summer. 

 - I spent 10 days in New Mexico visiting my big sister. She was recovering from a concussion due to a bicycle injury but we still managed to go camping and see the milky way. 
- We both then traveled to Oaxaca city where the class consciousness was very high (graffiti deep cuts referencing the Paris commune..) and the food was very very good. Together with my grandpa and my aunt we all attended the [Gueleguetza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guelaguetza) which receives a delegation of dancers from my grandfather’s hometown. 
- Then we drove to my grandfather’s hometown in Oaxaca to attend a week long annual festival that celebrates Mixtec and Hispanic religion. 
- Finally I went to Mexico City for 2 weeks and spent time with my aunt and cousin who I’m going to be living with. I was able to venture around the city on my own and get somewhat of a handle on the public transit system without the help of my family. 

Coming back from all that travel felt like “ok now what.” Not having a job in this tough market has definitely led to some emotional lows and stress. I’m trying not to beat myself up for being unemployed. Sometimes I feel like a leach to those around me! I’m feeling pretty lost these days career wise but I think that’s normal for a 25 year old in this economy What has been really helpful has been networking with older Wellesley alums, especially ones in Mexico City. They have been extremely sweet and encouraging which always gives me an extra push to keep going.

**Regardless, I’ve decided to move to Mexico City on November 8th.** I still have decent savings since i’m not spending money at my mom’s house. Even though my aunt won’t be charging me to live with her, I want to help contribute to the house. With my family’s loving help, I know that I’ll figure something out! Plus I have an intense motivation to get myself settled so I can start hosting y’all when you come visit. The next soapbox you receive from me will be from Mexico >;)
