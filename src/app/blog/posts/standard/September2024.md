# The Soapbox
## a friendly newsletter from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Hello friends! It’s been about five months since I sent you a soapbox. We ran through spring, skipped through summer, and are now changing colors with the leaves. I last left you with news of my rejection from Fulbright and acceptance into the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Since then, I’ve moved through life with a determination to make it to Mexico City while sharpening my political development here in Boston with the PSL.

 But before we get into all that, I want to tell you about my summer.

One of the coolest things I got to do this summer (and my whole life) was officiate my friend Eity’s wedding! I had an incredible time with their family in the beautiful backdrop of wine country California. Eity’s family was so loving and they treated everyone like blood. It set the tone for my summer by reminding me how much I miss my own Mexican family gatherings. Luckily, my family planned somewhat of a grand reunion for a week in July in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. We pooled our money together and got ourselves a nice resort with an open bar by the beach. The only problem was I had no “Paid Time Off” after the wedding but I said fuck it. I told my boss I was prepared for the consequences because I was going to see my family and nothing was gonna change that. I got the scolding of a lifetime… but when I was sitting there on the beach with my family I said to myself, “Yeah. This was always going to be worth it.” 

This summer lit a fire under my ass to keep climbing whatever obstacles are in the way of what’s important to me, my Mexican family.

Despite all the good times, I’ve realized some of the things I had hoped in Soapbox #1 might not come to fruition. I have to trust that I am getting where I am going even if it’s slowly and not on the timeline I imagined. Real life is more interesting than that. I’ve made some moves to help moves things along though. I realized I could afford to go part time at my job so that I could dedicate more time applying for Mexican duel citizenship, studying Spanish, and earnestly investigating different opportunities to move there (such as a graduate program). 

It’s been two months since I went part-time and I’m on the struggle bus financially (but managing!). I’m also trying to be more disciplined with studying rather than just using my free time to see my friends and say yes to every single PSL event.

Now before we say goodbye, I’ll share something I’ve been keeping from some of you. **Today is a special day for me because it marks exactly one year since I started taking testosterone.** This has caused some physical changes to my body but I remain mostly the same. I now ask people to use they/them pronouns when referring to me because I identify as non-binary (yes, even though I take testosterone!). 

**I was scared that starting this process would make my life harder and more complicated but it’s only made my life more loving.**
