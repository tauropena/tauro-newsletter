## from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Hello friends! We meet again but this time in a the fresh new year of 2025. So much has happened since we last spoke and I’m so lucky I get to share it with all of you. Buckle in cause this is a long one! Just a week ago I achieved a massive milestone and officially became a Mexican citizen. I had to fight God for that piece of government paper, totaling 7 trips to the embassy over the past four months. The first person I called was my mom who was congratulatory but not as emotional as I had hoped. When I asked her why she wasn’t more excited she said “To me, you became a Mexican the day you were born. Your heart has always been Mexican”. She’s right! Nobody can grant or deny me my identity. It was a heartwarming thing to remember after spending months trying to prove it to someone. That being said, having citizenship is important to me for a few reasons. 

1. It allows me to live in Mexico City without needed a student, work visa, etc. 
2. On paper, it distinguishes me from the US American expats moving to and gentrifying Mexico City.

I will literally be a Mexican living in Mexico! Obviously the issues are deeper than the fine print but I already know, for example, I will be immersing myself in Spanish rather than playing a part in converting whole neighborhoods in Mexico City into English… One of my favorite responses to getting Mexican citizenship came from my Puerto Rican friend Izzy (Puerto Rico is also experiencing a gentrification crisis by US americans on the island) who said **Un día vamos a volver a nuestras tierras en paz y crear un mundo nuevo sin imperialismo.** I know he is right. 

Ironically, the most hesitation I’ve had to move to Mexico came after the election of Donald Trump.

I started writing this edition of the soapbox on the night before Trump’s inauguration in D.C just a few hours away from where I am. That night, snow covered the city of Boston and I reflected on how I felt when he was first inaugurated and I was just 16 years old. Back then, watching him become president filled me with such a immense sense of fear that it effectively immobilized me for much of the day. At 24, I understand that I have so much more to lose than I did at 16 and yet I watch the snow fall with a sense of tranquility because my political analysis has never been sharper, kinder, more disciplined and I have never been more organized in my life. Of course, I hate him and I’m certainly not happy that he is president again but I also refuse follow any politic that tells me I should be preparing a funeral. I’m not dead yet and I don’t plan on dying soon. In fact, I know that Trump did not win because people are more uniquely awful than before. 

In 2020 Biden got 81 million votes compared to Trump’s 74 million. In 2024 Trump got 77 million votes. 3 million votes is not enough to be considered a landslide in a country with 258 million eligible voters, so no, it wasn’t the population that moved in a massive wave to the right._The election should first and foremost be understood as a complete failure of the democratic party._ 

The real reason why Trump won is because 7 million people that voted for democrats in 2020 stayed home this election and it’s not because Kamala Harris is a woman.  _Every single ballot protecting abortion rights was more popular than Kamala Harris in this election (even in states that went for Trump)._ She did not lose because she is black. She got 9 million more votes than Hillary Clinton did. The democrats lost because they waged a racist campaign and presidency that catered to moderate republicans thus revealing exactly what they are, the left wing of the same bird. 

At the election watch party hosted at the Boston Liberation Center, me and other PSL organizers were celebrating the campaign we had completed over the course of 8 months for our socialist presidential candidate Claudia de la Cruz and Karina Garcia. Of course, we didn’t expect them to win that night. The campaign was merely a way for us to talk about socialism in Boston during a small window of time every four years when people are actually open to talking about politics. After helping collect over 15,000 signatures from registered voters for a third party candidate (the specifics of which truly reveal how undemocratic this country is), I was able to talk more in depth to people in my neighborhood about what an explicitly socialist candidate means.  From train stops, grocery stores, bus stops, to street corners, I found that my black, brown, immigrant, working class neighborhood was extremely receptive to socialism. I would say 95% of the people I talked to wanted to learn more. The only people who told me I was being irresponsible or throwing my vote away were people in the affluent and white parts of Boston. 

**This election cycle solidified something for me, people are hungry for an alternative to the two ruling class parties and that is very exciting.**

_During the Claudia and Karina campaign, the Party for Socialism and Liberation actually asked me to give a speech during a rally in Dorchester, Boston for Claudia where I connected the revolutionary history of my neighborhood which consists of Haitian, Cape Verdean, Dominican, and Vietnamese immigrants. From Haiti forming the first free black republic, Vietnam kicking out three of the baddest colonial powers, Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a socialist in Boston and so much more, Dorchester residents come from greatness!_

This all gave me pause in my dream to go to Mexico because dang! Socialism is no longer a dirty word in this country. People are eager to build a viable political force that puts people over profit, recognizing that democrats and republicans are incapable of this. Organizing in my neighborhood has shown me that. More importantly, I’ve realized that by engaging in local struggles I have embedded myself as part of this community in a way I haven’t felt since I lived in North Carolina. In fact, after moving away for college, towns just became places I just so happened to live in. They were transactional spaces viewed merely as a place holder or a stepping stone. Boston was this to me for a long time. Yet after moving to Dorchester I’ve had so many amazing interactions with long time residents here like going to the picket line for the Boston Teachers Union at the elementary school down my road, riding in a bus with nurses to protest the shutting down of the only hospital with an emergency room in our neighborhood, attending hearings on the closure, [writing an article on it](https://liberationnews.org/mass-democrats-could-have-saved-carney-hospital-if-they-wanted-to/), going to a presidential rally for a socialist candidate at a local church, giving a speech at it, and so much more. It hit me that a place becomes a home when you start fighting for it. For the first time since I was 18 years old, I am no longer a tourist of the city I live in. I’m a resident.

_On January 1st I was offered full membership into the Party for Socialism and Liberation after completing a successful 9 month candidacy period_

**Part of me thinks I had to stay here and learn how to make this place my home before I could leave.** I could move somewhere else, live there for 50 years without lifting a finger for it and be doomed to be a tourist forever. I’m tired of being a tourist in Mexico. I want it to become my home. I’m trying to build a beautiful life and so it’s critical that I find the beauty in everything. I’m getting pretty damn good at it here in Boston. Maybe my optimism can be confused for naivety but it’s how I’m going to survive all of this. It’s why my organizing energizes me rather than burns me out. 

It’s why I’ve become such a good fighter.


Oh! And one last thing. **I’ve started going by the name Tauro (t-OW-roh).** It’s the spanish word for Taurus hehe. I’ll try to send another soapbox sooner so the update isn’t so long!!
