## a friendly newsletter from yours truly (¯ ³¯)♡

Thank you for being here! I was inspired to start this newsletter by my mother and her friend Helen who met 25 years ago in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They were two foreigners in middle america who spent their free time teaching each other how to cook meals from their respective home countries. Helen eventually moved back to her native city of Paris and my mom went on to raise me and my sister in North Carolina. 

Over a decade would pass before they saw each other again but Helen always sent my mom a brief email at the end of the year. Despite the distance, time, and lack of texts or calls, an email once a year was enough to maintain their friendship for over 2 decades.  We were able to visit Helen this past summer in France and I could go on for hours about what an incredible host she was. I’ve never been interested in visiting Europe but it felt more like visiting an old friend. Here she is with my mother in front of Helen’s family castle in the French country side.

During this visit I couldn’t help but fantasize about having my own castle just so I could host my friends and their loved ones. I wouldn’t ever want them to hesitate in asking if they could come stay with me. I would be such a good host! The reality is, **even if I haven’t heard your voice in years or seen you in a decade, I will still care for you because I remember what you were like when we met. I still remember what it was like to be younger with you and I still have a lot of love for you even if its in the back of my mind.** I don’t want to let time or distance rob us of our bond. I figured if an email every once in a while was enough for Helen and Teresa, it can be enough for us. 

_and I don’t want to download Instagram!_

Anyways. I hope you enjoyed some of my thinking process going into this. Here is a brief list of important plot points in my character arc from graduation until now. 
<!-- how do I change the font for lists? -->
- started my job as a researcher at the Lehoczky Lab in Boston (studying mammalian limb regeneration) 
- successfully overcame a big bad heartbreak
- finally admitted to myself that I don’t like lab research! My first job helped me recognize that I don’t want a career or a PhD in lab research, despite a very kind/supportive boss and healthy lab environment. 
-  my mom won an affordable housing lottery and bought a house in Davidson, NC (yay)
- I got a perm lol
- moved to Dorchester, Boston with my close friends Jaime and Eity (who I met after Wellesley through a mutual friend) 
- made it a goal to move to Mexico City by 2025
- my older sister accepted a staff nurse position at a hospital in Albuquerque indefinitely (yay)
- applied to the Fulbright for Mexico and to the Asia Luce Scholars Program 
- got rejected from the Asia Luce Scholars Program 
- cut my perm 
- am waiting to hear from the Fulbright 
- hoping to move in with my mom if the Fulbright doesn’t work out to save some money and figure out a different career!

Well! That’s all for now. Stay tuned for exciting updates that I feel are coming up in the new year. 

## Besitos ( ˘⌣˘)♡(˘⌣˘ )
